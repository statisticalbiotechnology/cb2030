    "# 3 Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how the dimensionality of the data affects the prediction accuracy. You have heard of the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) and, in bioinformatics, often we are subject to it just because of the amount of genes on a genome and the low number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, you have also learned at least one way to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Here we will use PCA to reduce the dimensions from around 20 thousand genes (dimensions) to a more manageable number of dimensions.\n",
    "First, you will need to choose if you normalize all the dimensions before performing the PCA, then you will be shown how much of the variance in the data is captured by the first components (remember that the normalization also changes the variance). With this information you will be able to have an educated guess on how many principal components you want to use to train the SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core PCA algorithm, as such, does not reduce the number of dimensions. It levarages co-variation of different variables (in different dimensions) to capture as much of total variations in as few dimensions, i.e. principal components, as possible. In contrast to dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP or tSNE, no information is lost. Thus, given the full output matrices from PCA, it should be possible to retrive original values (check Singular Value Decomposition, e.g. in the lecture about PCA, for more details). After the transformation, the samples should vary a lot across the first few components, and little across all the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, PCA is used to retrive only a few first principal components, most often just the first two. The idea is that the first components should correspond to meaningful variance, driven by the the same (biological) processes in multiple samples, thus leading to co-variation. The other components can be, for some purposes, disregarded as \"noise\". By picking only few first components, PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction. That is very useful for visualization, as one can often show in 2D most of the variation corresponding to effects of key factors structuring the data. Another application can be to reduce the number of dimensions to avoid the curse of dimensionality, e.g. to improve the performance of an SVM-based predictor. This is what we will try to do in this exercise.\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3.1 Explain one of the causes of **curse of dimensionality**. Why adding more information doesn't always increase the performance? It can be a characteristic of biological data/systems or a general property of the algorithms prone to the problem.\n",
    "* 3.2 After performing PCA on our data, how much of the variance did the first two components explain? What was the minimal number of components which explained most of the variation?\n",

    "* 3.4 Did the dimensionality reduction improve the perfomance of the predictor? Provide parameters you have used and give the one cause you find most probable/influencial to explain the fact the performance did/did not improve?
