    "\n",
    "On this lab, we will try to understand the underlying mechanisms and concepts behind differential expression analysis and multiple hypothesis testing. You will be asked to reflect on some core concepts of the methods and to write down your interpretations. It is important that you understand what you are doing, and thoughtful answers are expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully complete the lab you have to answer all questions and submit them in **PDF format** in Canvas. For the question in sections 1-5, only a **few sentences** per question is enough. You can write more detailed answers for the bonus questions, but precise and on-point answers are appreciated. You can, and should, discuss with your classmates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also be provided with some optional bonus questions that involve a little more research and programming on your part, but successful completion of those will award you extra points in the final examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin! As in every notebook, we first begin by importing packages."

    "## 1 Differential expression analysis, an intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have learned, differential expression analysis tries to answer the following question: Is there any **significant** difference between the expression of two (or more) different conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will first be exploring the concepts using simulated data, which allows us to finely control what we are looking at and most importantly, know the true model behind the data. Later you will be asked to explore these concepts using real life data, on which you will have to look for the effects without knowing if there is really an undelying one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulated data is very basic, and corresponds to two separately generated sets.\n",
    "On the first the data is generated by sampling from **two separate** normal distributions, with the data points colored according to which distribution they are generated from.\n",
    "On the second set, the data is generated by a **single** normal distribution, but with the same mean and standard deviation as the combined distribution from the previous set, and where the points are colored at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the language of differential expression, the colors represent the different conditions we want to test (e.g. treated/untreated, healthy/sick, etc.).\n",
    "The second data set then represents our **null hypothesis** $H_0$, and it says that there is no difference between the \"expression\" of the two conditions.\n",
    "Finally, the first set then represents the **alternative hypothesis** $H_1$ that says *there is* a difference between the two conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope the explanation of this was clear, but in case you have any questions, please ask the TA as this is very important for the rest of the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's try to get an intuition on differential expression fist. After executing the code below you will be presented with 2 plots and some sliders.\n",
    "The sliders control the parameters used for generating the samples from the two different sets, and plot the results.\n",
    "**The catch here is that you do not know which plot represents data under $H_0$ and which represents data under $H_1$.**\n",
    "Every time you move one of the sliders, the data is regenerated, and $H_0$ and $H_1$ **will be assigned randomly the left or right panes**, and you will have to reasses which one do you think represents the null and alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play around with the sliders as long as you feel necessary to answer these questions.\n",
    "An explanation of what the slides control:\n",
    "* Distance: the difference between the mean of each distribution in $H_1$\n",
    "* Dispersion: the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of those distributions\n",
    "* Samples: The number of samples from each distribuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "* 1.1 What is the influence of **each** variable in your ability to distinguish between $H_0$ and $H_1$?\n",
    "* 1.2 How do the different variables interact with each other? And how does it relate to your ability to distinguish the data?\n",
    "* 1.3 It is easy to see that often data under $H_1$ looks like data under $H_0$, but do you think you could ever misidentify data under $H_0$ as data under $H_1$?\n",

    "### Questions\n",
    "* 2.1 Look up the Student's t-test on your favourite online encyclopedia. What are the assumptions this test makes about the data? Do this assumptions hold here?\n",
    "* 2.2 The t-test gives us a p-value. How do you interpret this value on this setup?\n",
    "* 2.3 Does the p-value confirm your intuitions from the previous part? How would you augment your previous answers (1.1 - 1.3) on that light?\n",
    "* 2.4 Our initial question was \"is there any significant difference between the two cases\". As an answer, it is usual to reject $H_0$ for p-values lower than 0.05. Pick a very small distance between both distributions and see if you could make it significant using the other sliders, specially the sample size, and then comment on the relations of statistical significance and biological significance."

    "\n",
    "So far we have been interested in each gene individually. We ask the differential expression question for each gene and answer it with a p-value from our statistical test.\n",
    "However, with the rich data generated from high-throughput experiments, we usually want to ask several different question (i.e. propose multiple hypothesis), and we thus move to the world of multiple hypothesis testing, where the p-value is loses some of its usefulness because it leads to high **family-wise error rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will here use the same data generation scheme as before, but done many times over for each $H_0$ and $H_1$. This takes much more time, so you will have the option of generating the data once and visualizing it in multiple ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way visualizing how a statistical test behaves with multiple hypothesis is to visualize the distribution of the p-values it generates, and we will explore why in the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will be able to generate data and visualize it using a histogram. Play around with it a while, use your best discretion on how many bins to use for the histogram, and answer the questions below.\n",
    "**Obs:** if you regenerate data, the plot will not automatically redraw.\n",
    "\n",
    "New sliders:\n",
    "* Tests: the number of times the data is generated and the t-test performed under each $H$\n",
    "* Bins: the number of bins in the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "* 3.1 When we say \"multiple hypothesis\", which are the hypothesis we are referring to?\n",
    "* 3.2 Explain with your own words how we can have high **family-wise error rate** even when using very strict p-value thresholds.\n",
    "* 3.3 Do you think it is easier to identify $H_0$ and $H_1$ in this setup? Why do you think that is the case?\n",

    "While we can, in this context, analyse both the data generated under $H_0$ and $H_1$ separately, in reality they are often mixed together, and we use the statistical test precisely to **tell if the data comes from $H_0$ or not**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen in the exercises above, given enough tests, you will almost always have instances where you reject the null hypothesis when it is true no matter which threshold of significance you choose. In this context, we call these errors **false discoveries**.\n",
    "The false discovery rate (FDR), then, is the rate on which these errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the next plot, you will see a **stacked histogram** on the left, showing the distribution of p-values of both $H$ visualized together, and you will see a red vertical line that shows your significance threshold (left of the line = significant).\n",
    "On the right you have a colection of small squares where each represents a test. They are ranked by p-value with the lowest on the top-left corner and the highest on the lower-right, and coloured by which $H$ it originated from ($H_0$&rarr;red, $H_1$&rarr;blue). As you move the threshold, you will notice that some of those will get shaded and change color (blue&rarr;green, red&rarr;orange), and those represent the test that are below your threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by moving the threshold slider, you will select on which tests you will reject the null, or in the context of differential expression, the data you believe to be *expressed differentially* between conditions, and that will contain data that is both **truly not coming from $H_0$** and those that were **incorrectly rejected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our very special case here, we know from before which data comes from $H_0$ and from $H_1$, so we can calculate the FDR exactly, and that will be shown on top of the pane on the right.\n",
