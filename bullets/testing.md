1. **Definition of Hypothesis Testing**:
   - A procedure used to determine whether a sample data set provides sufficient evidence to reject a stated null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.

2. **Null Hypothesis (*H₀*) and Alternative Hypothesis (*H₁*)**:
   - The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect, relationship, or difference. It serves as a default assumption.
   - The alternative hypothesis is what a researcher wants to prove, suggesting an effect, relationship, or difference.

3. **Test Statistics**:
   - A value derived from sample data and used to make decisions about the hypotheses. Different tests have different test statistics.

4. **Sampling Distribution under the Null Hypothesis**:
    - The distribution of a test statistic assuming the null hypothesis is true.

4. **Permutation Tests**:
    - A non-parametric method used to test the null hypothesis by generating all possible distributions of observations (or a large subset of them) under the assumption that the groups are exchangeable under the null hypothesis.
    - They work by rearranging the observed data points and recalculating the test statistic for each permutation, aproximating a sampling distribution.

4. **P value**:
   - Represents the probability of obtaining the observed data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true.
   - A smaller *p* value suggests that the observed data would be unlikely under the null hypothesis, providing evidence against *H₀*.

5. **Significance Level (α)**:
   - A predetermined threshold (often set at 0.05) that dictates whether the *p* value is considered small enough to reject the null hypothesis.
   - If *p* value < α, the results are statistically significant, and we reject *H₀*.

6. **False Positives and False Negatives**:
   - **False Positive (Type I Error)**: Rejecting *H₀* when it is true. 
   - **False Negative (Type II Error)**: Failing to reject *H₀* when the alternative hypothesis is true.

8. **Limitations & Misinterpretations**:
   - P-values only provide the strength of evidence against *H₀*, not the size of the effect or its practical significance.
   - A *p* value does not give the probability that either hypothesis is true.
   - Results can be statistically significant without being practically significant, and vice versa.
