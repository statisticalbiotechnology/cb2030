## Preparations for lecture on General Linear Models

As a preparation for the General Linear Models convocation, make yourself acquainted with the material below, and subsequently complete any tasks assigned to you in canvas.

1. Watch the [Video Lecture on Linear Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9qB1FBNZ3k), and its [slides](slides/LinearModels.pdf)
2. Read the [Simple Linear regression](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.06-linear-regression.html#Simple-Linear-Regression) subsection in VanderPlas. (Skip the other subsection of the chapter.)
3. Read up Chapter 10.1-6 and 11.1-2 in Downey on [Regression](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2011.html). Their associated code can be found [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/chap10ex.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/chap11ex.ipynb)
4. Investigate the jupyter notebook on [Linear Models](../nb/linear/readme.md)
