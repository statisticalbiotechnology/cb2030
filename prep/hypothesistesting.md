## Preparations for lecture on Hypothesis Testing

As a preparation for the Hypothesis Testing convocation, make yourself acquainted with the material below, and subsequently complete any tasks assigned to you in canvas.

1. Watch the [Video Lecture on Hypothesis Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLmqmTCu6lg), and its [slides](slides/HypothesisTesting.pdf)
2. Read the chapter 8.3 and 9.1-9.5 in Downey on [hypothesis testing](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html#sec89). The associated code is available [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/chap09ex.ipynb).
    * The book gives a different method for how to derive *p* values from samples than most other books. They derive *p* values from simulations, rather than to look them up from formulas or tables.  If you prefer a traditional explanation, try e.g.  [wikipedia's entry on *t* tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test).
    * Unfortunately, Downey does not give a distinct definition of a *p* value. The correct definition is ["the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), however, in the glosary 9.13 an other definitions is given. Try to convince yourself that you understand why the glosaries definitions is problematic. See for instance [this wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values).
3. Investigate the jupyter notebook on [Differential expression anlaysis of the TCGA breast cancer set](../nb/testing/readme)  
4. Read previous years [questions and answers](../qa/testing) on the material


Slightly moderated versions of your questions will be posted [here](../questions/testing.md)
