## Preparations for lecture on Auto Encoders

As a preparation for the Auto Encoders convocation, make yourself acquainted with the material below, and subsequently complete any tasks assigned to you in canvas.  

1. Read the chapters on [Auto Encoders](https://www.kaell.se/dsbook/unsupervised/autoenc.html) and its [example implementation](https://www.kaell.se/dsbook/unsupervised/VAEofCarcinomas.html) 

## Additional material

* A nice Blog post on [VAE](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73)

* If you want more details, on VAE, the original [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) is nice, but might be challenging.
