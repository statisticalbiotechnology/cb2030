As a preparation for the Variational Auto Encoders convocation, make yourself acquainted with the material below, and subsequently complete any tasks assigned to you in canvas.  
*Note that this is an advanced topic and you will not be required to get all the details in the material*.

1. Watch the [Video Lecture on Variational Auto Encoders](https://youtu.be/dPRPGA0krOs), and its [slides](slides/VariationalAutoEncoders.pdf)
2. Read the Blog post on [VAE](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73)
3. Have a look at the example code in the jupyter [notebook](../nb/vae/)

Additional material:
* If you want more details, on VAE, the original [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) is nice.
* A bit out of the context, but still relevant for the lecture, this [tool](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) illustrate the effects of architecture and regularization schemes have when training a ANN for different dataset.
